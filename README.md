## 4 Technical Background

### 4.1 Software Requirements

#### 4.1.1 HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It provides the structure of the website and is used to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

#### 4.1.2 CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements on a web page. It allows for the separation of content and design, making it easier to maintain and update the website's appearance.

#### 4.1.3 Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It allows for rapid development and ensures a consistent design across the application.

#### 4.1.4 React.js
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently. React's virtual DOM ensures high performance and a smooth user experience.

#### 4.1.5 Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to build scalable network applications using JavaScript on the server-side. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for building real-time applications.

#### 4.1.6 Express.js
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities.

#### 4.1.7 PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system. It is known for its robustness, scalability, and support for advanced data types and indexing. PostgreSQL ensures data integrity and provides strong security features, making it a reliable choice for storing application data.

### 4.2 Storing Data on PostgreSQL
Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which provides robust data management and querying capabilities. PostgreSQL supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable transactions and data integrity.

### 4.3 Advantages of PostgreSQL
- **Open-source and free to use:** PostgreSQL is open-source, reducing the cost of ownership.
- **Highly extensible and customizable:** PostgreSQL supports custom functions, data types, and extensions.
- **Supports advanced data types and indexing:** PostgreSQL provides support for JSON, XML, and full-text search.
- **Strong community support:** PostgreSQL has a large and active community, providing extensive documentation and support.

### 4.3.1 IDE
The project is developed using Visual Studio Code.

### 4.3.2 Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a powerful and flexible code editor with support for various extensions and integrations. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging, making it an ideal choice for web development.

### 4.3.3 Lucide Icons
Lucide Icons is a collection of open-source, scalable vector icons. It provides a wide range of icons that can be easily customized and integrated into the application, enhancing the user interface.
